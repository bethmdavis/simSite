# simSite
---
These are the files for the Robotarium Simulator website. It is meant to be used in conjunction with the Robotarium Simulator server: https://github.com/bethmdavis/simServer
To use, open `index.html` in your browser and utilize the block programming interface to create a simulation. When you are ready to see it run, click "Simulate" at the top of the page. Currently the generated video won't load in the site when used locally, so you would need to go the `[path_to_simServer]/static/uploads` directory to see the results of your simulation.

Note: I did not write this code, it was created by a team at Georgia Tech
